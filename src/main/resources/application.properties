spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization=true
#when =true, delays the initialization of database (data.sql, or flyway) until hibernate creates Entity Beans
#Among the changes introduced in 2.5.0, it seems now the data.sql script is executed before Hibernate is initialized:
#And since I'm relying on the ORM mechanism (i.e. Hibernate) to create the schema from the entity definition,
#the database table does not exist at the moment the initialization SQL script is executed.

spring.flyway.enabled=false
#disabling flyway for hibernate to manage h2 schema in testing

#spring.profiles.active=local-mysql # I sat active profile using Intellij runtime variables
